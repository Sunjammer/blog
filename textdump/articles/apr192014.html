<h3 id="flash-is-dead-flash-is-dead-flash-is-dead">Flash is dead. Flash is dead. Flash is dead.</h3>
<p>While all us actual Flash developers knew in our hearts that it would be a slow Java-like death at worst, over many many years, rather than the point blank execution certain public personalities seemed to be chanting for, it was nonetheless a painful blow to our foundation. By 2010, I had spent 10 years, my adult life entire, working as a Flash developer, and the dawning realization that the world you have lived on may actually <em>not</em> be flat was fairly terrifying, even existential. </p>
<p>Rewind 11 years, and I had been convinced my work would be in design and art and music, and Flash was letting me do all those things in one space, accented with some -at the time- very slight toe-dipping into the world of programming, a world I'd personally imagined wasn't for me at all. I'd opened Codewarrior as a kid and recoiled violently back into the world of pens and paper. </p>
<p>I feel it's appropriate to say I grew up alongside Flash. As my skills with Flash grew, Flash would grow to meter out further challenges. Flash made me a programmer, because I had to be a programmer to do the things I wanted to do. While my repertoire of skills stayed eclectic, doing video editing and composite, sound production, 3d animation and rigging, still spending hours in Photoshop, Flash was the nexus where all those requirements met in a point of actual creation. </p>
<h3 id="flash-made-me-a-programmer-flash-is-dead">Flash made me a programmer. Flash is dead.</h3>
<p>Flash has been "dead" several times over. Not yet quite propelled so violently into every home, the way Youtube eventually would, Flash was hidden behind expensive tooling, and eventually new capricious owners, Adobe, who seemed altogether confused about what exactly it was that they had acquired. But in my mind it took the community reverse engineering of the SWF format and the first free publically available Flash compiler, Motion-twin's MTASC, and asset-embedding utilities like SWFMill, to really whip Flash into a shape where development spread organically, source and competency was being properly shared, and the popularity of the format absolutely boomed in art circles. I think it's safe to say that without MTASC in particular, Flash would have been left in the dust to rot. </p>
<p>Mobile was really the point where I realized my perspective had to shift. We've seen Moore's law become more or less obsolete through diminishing returns relative to increased power consumption, and mobile's requirements of low power computing has really shoved us face first into some pretty fundamental reevaluation, I think, of what makes a good program. I wasn't blind; I knew Flash was a pretty hungry platform, and I knew my own Flash programs would by necessity be hungrier. I was of the opinion, at this point, that Flash was a desktop thing, because desktop and laptop computing was cheap and incredibly powerful. When the question of Flash on mobile came up, it was almost laughable to consider, to me. It seemed obvious that mobile was never Flash's intended environment, and any application in such fashion would be a poorly judged endeavor.</p>
<p>But mobile persisted... I eventually traded in my iPhone for an Android phone, and while I'd messed about with Java, C and C# in the past, Android was the first time I saw a genuine use for Java in particular. I made the requisite pair of AIR attempts just to see how they ran, and as I'd thought it was just hilariously bad stuff. You just couldn't compare to native. </p>
<h3 id="leaving-the-nest">Leaving the nest</h3>
<p>As a personal challenge, I decided I'd build myself a native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.doomsday.android.downcount">egg timer application</a> in Java. I found the experience hugely educational in many ways. First of all, it was realizing that my AS3 skills transferred almost completely without friction to Java. The ease by which I could dance between AS3 and Java became less an indicator that I was awesome, and more that I'd become sort of blinded by AS3, and the need to conform to a language and a platform: The need to "stay home". It was such a beautiful moment, to see that I had essentially left the nest, and discovered I was capable of flight. </p>
<p>One year I was speaking at the always-wonderful Reasons conference in Brighton, I had the post-session rush (I didn't die!!!!11), and decided I'd get absolutely wasted that evening. Luck would have it I'd run into Nicolas Canasse, the creator of the Haxe language, and part of the Flash-liberating team behind MTASC. I was just drunk enough to get over that star struck terror, and got into a discussion with him which, among other things, included me falling flat on my ass because of my idiotic new shoes and the slippery floor, god damnit, I swear I wasn't that drunk! </p>
<p><strong>*recomposes*</strong></p>
<p>Anyway. I had been familiar with Haxe for years, not least because of a friend on the (sadly dead) FlashCoders mailing list who would in gentle terms call me an idiot for not moving to Haxe. The case I brought to Nicolas, during our conversation, was the stability of the C++ target, and the capacity to write both the AIR frontend and a native extension backend in the same codebase. I was still basically mortified by C++, a *language &amp;so **full of * conflicting symbology and religion I considered it tantamount to going back to cave paintings for communication, but <em>Haxe</em> was like ActionScript with Java features I'd grown to love, specifically type parametrization and iterators, and the prospect of such a gentle turn onto a freeway across a terrain I otherwise saw as a poisonous wasteland inhabited by crab-men was very enticing indeed.</p>
<h3 id="day-of-the-croissant">Day of the Croissant</h3>
<p>It took my friend John Davies' embryonic Croissant Fighter shooting game project for me to really give that direction a push though. He had built an AIR prototype that frankly ran like dog doodoo on my phone, and I gave it a couple of shots of optimization, including a highly minimalistic Stage3D test that ran quite a bit better, but still just <em>felt</em> bad. I built a tiny Java test case of dragging a circle around to dodge incoming circles, and while the Stage3D build rendered at comparable rates, the sensation of dragging that circle simply felt better in the Java build, with what I perceived as noticeable input latency. </p>
<p>I'm sort of a terrible guy to bring onto a game like that, because I'm a pretty big shooter fan, to the point of owning arcade boards for my favorites, and having grown up wanting to <em>make</em> R-Type ever since first playing the Game Boy version in 1991. As a result, my expectations of any such game of <em>my</em> making was pretty stratospheric, and this input latency would not do.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity fuelled by my meeting with Nicolas, and some community buzz surrounding the Haxe NME platform, a Flash-like API wrapping a C++ layer promising "native performance" on mobile targets, I discovered first that as with Java, transferring AS3 to Haxe was trivial. It took me a few hours from first install to first build, and NME not only rendered better with less fuss than the Stage3D build, but with none of the signature input lag. I was sold. I sent John the build. He was sold. Croissant Fighter was going to be a Haxe game.</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-language">Principles of language</h3>
<p>I think, as a foreigner, you need to express a certain sense of humility about the nation you are visiting. You want to avoid being the tourist, in the sense that you want to mesh with the natives as best as you can. You are, after all, a guest. With time, you may begin to express yourself as a native, and even consider yourself one. But starting out, you need to understand that the world was born from many places, some of which may run counter to your own. When learning Japanese, I was struck by the beauty of the "ka" particle, capable of altering the meaning of a sentence entire, but only once the sentence was complete. In programming, I expect, this particle, or keyword, would be a prefix, not a suffix. </p>
<p>This kind of linguistic relativism rings really strong with me, because I've grown to feel my adult life has been one long chain of attempts at reigning in control of my scattered, borderline ADHD brain. Even now, I routinely fall back on English in conversation with Norwegian friends, mostly as a kind of defensive mechanism I suppose, because English is a language capable of expressing modern principles <em>concretely</em>, whereas I feel Norwegian is a language of fallbacks and insecurities, compromised by a history of uninterrupted cultural besiegement.</p>
<p>So, coming to Haxe, my initial frustrations with things like the lack of a traditional for-loop statement (what, you mean I need to write while loops? Travesty!) gave way to an understanding that iterators can express any for loop you'd wish for, with less syntax masturbation, and even to an understanding that while loops are screwdriver-elegant in how brutally useful they are at the precise thing they set out to do. The while/for pair was less a dichotomy and more of a beautiful marriage, one carrying the other where needed. </p>
<p>I was absolutely floored by how strongly I agreed with these principles, principles that seemed soundly centered on change and adaptability. This was a language <em>about language</em>, where I could choose my level of engagement ranging from the loosest of expressions to the crystal clearest of intents. Whereas AS3 was a kind of bespectacled JavaScript with body dysmorphic disorder, and Java was a ringmaster more than a language of expression, Haxe could straddle both camps, any camps. No camps. You could write Haxe to write your Haxe for you. You could write Haxe that let you write Haxe differently. My mind frankly boggled at both its elegance of control, and its principles of freedom.</p>
<p>I stopped my tourist indignation, and labored to become a native.</p>
<h3 id="early-rumbles-with-nme">Early rumbles with NME</h3>
<p>It turns out these principles of native/tourist apply to open source as well, and NME was a brutally open source environment. NME, frankly, did not match its sales pitch. The stated goal of NME was to support the full Flash API, and while it did support a scarily large subset, there were elements of Flash it simply couldn't realistically match, especially in terms of Flash's embracing of software rendering. Try as hard as you might, traditional Flash-style approaches like BitmapData blitting and video layering, webcam manipulation, easy networking and more, were simply out of reach, though the API and documentation would still promise its existence. </p>
<p>As a result I found working with NME more or less like having an extended conversation with a pathological liar. It felt like every time I turned a corner, some prospect I'd been promised was just another cardboard stage prop, and development repeatedly staggered as a result, especially in the area of multimedia. Video was a no-go, and audio seemed tied together with spiderwebs at best. While we'd gradually built a fairly robust understanding of how to render our graphics very effectively, to be repeatedly disappointed by bouts with audio in particular was grinding our patience down to a wafer. We were both musicians, and we had been offered music by Ceephax Acid Crew, and we couldn't even play the music right? </p>
<p>Through my frustration, I also realized that NME was free and open source. Nobody <em>owed</em> me this functionality - though in all fairness I felt I should've been warned rather than promised. Again, I needed to drop my tourist indignation and get my hands dirty. We branched NME, and made the necessary modifications to fully support our needs on Android at least, rewriting the Java layer and learning how to link Haxe methods to Java methods through the JNI. Audio ceased, for the most part, to be the problem. But a dangerous seed was planted in me: By digging through the C++ and Java NME source, I'd looked into the abyss. I wanted to go there.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-the-footprint">Minimizing the footprint</h3>
<p>I'd learned, through being told repeatedly by NME that it was an expert freelance police officer, and that it had been in car chases all day, and that it was married to a supernova, that I needed to pick my uses well. NME handled input and assets <em>beautifully</em>, and had some select rendering methods that ran blazingly fast. Our engine evolved to eschew as much of the flash API as possible, focusing instead on the NME version of the Graphics API, which proved to match its Flash sibling in its immense flexibility but with better performance, especially using the TileSheet API for accelerated batch rendering of sprite sheets and the drawTriangles API for doing arbitrary meshes. By the time we were making proper headway, our footprint on the Flash API presented by NME was absolutely minimal, and I started wondering why I couldn't just cut out all that fat and have a minimal API with proper OpenGL access instead of going through this abstraction layer.</p>
<h3 id="lime-and-openfl">Lime and OpenFL</h3>
<p>As NME was rebranded to OpenFL, the best takeaway from that whole thing has honestly been the decoupling of the frontend from the backend, with Sven Bergström's Lime library offering an alternative wrapping of the native backend, giving much improved direct access to hardware. </p>
<p>This separation and refocus for OpenFL itself thoroughly accelerated development across the board. In my experience, within a couple of months OpenFL was twice the platform NME had been in terms of stability, and I was personally very happy that real efforts were being spent on replacing NME's audio with an OpenAL-based solution. With NME, I'd felt like a crazy old man shouting at the clouds hoping for things to change, but with OpenFL I felt like the cavalry had arrived and things were finally going to get fixed.</p>
<p>It helped considerably that the same thing had been happening to Haxe since the 3.0 project, with a renewed effort towards open source, with a pronounced Github presence and the new Haxe Foundation. With OpenFL and Haxe 3, I saw a very real maturation in the community that really strengthened my urge to stick around. Haxe was no longer this little weird idiosyncratic academic thing. </p>
<p>With Adobe's placing of Flash in maintenance mode, Haxe had become the real ActionScript Next, and OpenFL was truly set to be the liberation of what the Flash platform had been: Free, broad, inclusive, creative coding. </p>
<h3 id="leaving-another-nest">Leaving another nest.</h3>
<p>When developing our tools to alleviate our issues with the Flash-API end of NME/OpenFL, we have become progressively more distanced from the Flash API altogether, until our current iteration, built exclusively on Lime, which pretty much chats with OpenGL directly for rendering and uses Lime's audio helper for talking to OpenAL, and grabs input events from SDL2. Minimizing our footprint during our first bouts with NME really helped this process. It's honestly been delightful seeing how agnostic our codebase truly was.</p>
<p>I'm not bound to the Flash API anymore. Haxe has liberated me to the point where I can think of it as a paint roller, doing the broad strokes, and letting less technically inclined developers work freely without fear, while I can dig into the C++ and Java layers whenever I need anything custom, or there are intricate questions to be answered. Flash made me a programmer, but Haxe is making me a better one, and NME/OpenFL whipped me into an even better one, with a deeper understanding of development as a whole. </p>
<p>It hurts to tear loose, but it's so, so good to be free. </p>

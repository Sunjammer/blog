I was tasked with writing a Kinect pointer service, tracking multiple users via a set of Kinect 1.0 cameras and allowing them to point to content projected on tiles arranged around them in a sphere.  

The software has full debug views of skeletons as well as calibration and prioritization tools, and transmits pointer data over UDP for any applications to hook into.

DConsole is a long running personal project, having been in development since 2006. Running primarily as a command-line interface layer that can be hooked into methods and properties of a running Flash application, it grew to include its own windowing system and plugin architecture, function as a general purpose extensible tooling platform for Flash developers.  

Plugins offer functionality ranging from profiling displays, measuring, eyedropping and snapshotting tools to heavier things like network traffic inspectors and bizarro IRC clients.  

A tinier Haxe library, disgustingly named Consolitis, is also [in progress](https://github.com/furusystems/consolitis), attempting to straddle the problem of building a proper cross plat alternative.

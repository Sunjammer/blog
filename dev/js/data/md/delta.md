Delta is a tiny, dependency-free, fully cross platform tweening engine written in Haxe.  

It arose from the need for a game development centric tweening solution with a lighter codebase and tighter control of global tween timing. Core features are simple type-safe tween function extensibility, per-component parameters, tween sequencing, event based synchronization of sequences, and a single core tick function to be driven by the game engine.  

Delta is currently undergoing collaborative development with the intent to reduce reliance on reflection via macros, improve tween target type safety, and integrate Delta as the core tweening solution in [Snow](http://underscorediscovery.github.io/snow/).

To build this children's storybook/minigame collection, I provided custom game engine and content creation tooling using Haxe 3 and the OpenFL framework. Though we had a specific device target, this approach allowed us to create and test content in a native desktop environment, as well as run development builds on convenient hardware, such as cheaper Android tablets.  

The engine offers bone and sprite sheet animation using hand-written tooling, music and audio effect playback, a high performance 2D rendering solution and rich scripting.  

Content and gameplay was implemented by [John Davies](http://slakinov.com) on contract for [Brothers & Sisters](http://www.brothersandsisters.co.uk/).
